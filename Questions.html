What is the contribution of India in the production of rice in the world? (Delhi 2011)<br>
Answer:<br>
India ranked 2nd with the production of 22% rice in the world. Only China produced more rice than India.<br>

Question 2.<br>
What is the meaning of ‘Common Property Resources’ (CRP)? (Delhi 2011)<br>
Answer:<br>
Common Property Resources are not owned by any person or group. They are available for all and can be used by any person. These CPRs provide fodder to the livestock and fuel woods for household uses to villagers.<br>

Question 3.<br>
How is the cropping intensity calculated in India? (Delhi 2009)<br>
Answer:<br>
Cropping intensity is calculated in percentage by using the following formula:<br>
Cropping Intensity (Cl) = Gross Cropped Area/Net Sown Area × 100<br>

Question 4.<br>
How is productive irrigation able to achieve high productivity in India? (All Indio 2009)<br>
Answer:<br>
In productive irrigation farming, water is used in high amount in per unit cultivated area. The main objective of this type of farming is to produce more and more yield by providing sufficient moisture to soil for cultivation. Thus, this type of farming can help India to achieve high productivity in India.<br>

Question 5.<br>
Explain the importance of irrigation for agriculture in India. (Delhi 2016)<br>
OR<br>
Why is the demand for water to irrigation increasing day by day in India? Explain any three reasons. (All Indio 2000)<br>
OR<br>
Why is irrigation necessary in India? Explain any three reasons. (Delhi 2008)<br>
Answer:<br>
irrigation is necessary for India for the following reasons: To Decrease the Dependency on Monsoon Rainfall After the decades of independence, India is still dependent on monsoon rainfall for agriculture production. Only 33% of agricultural land is irrigated and rest is dependent on rainfall for soil moisture. To decrease the dependency on monsoon, rainfall irrigation is necessary.<br>
To Increase Production Agricultural production under rainfed areas is low and yield is very low. To increase agricultural production in India irrigation is necessary.<br>
To Maintain Balance between Population and Food Production Foodgrain production in India is very low and its growth rate is very low as compared to the increase in population. To provide food to increasing population growth, increase in production of foodgrains is required. Thus, irrigation is necessary.<br>    
Question 6.<br>
“Land resources are more crucial to the livelihood of the people depending on agriculture.” Support this statement with any three suitable arguments. (Delhi 2015, 2012, 2010)<br>
OR<br>
How is a land resource more crucial to the livelihood of the people depending on agriculture in India? Explain.(All India 2010)<br>
Answer:<br>
Most of the Indians are dependent on agriculture directly or indirectly for their subsistence. Thus, the land resource becomes more important. Importance of land resource in agriculture can be understood by the following points:<br>
* Dependence of agriculture on a land resource is high as compared to the secondary or tertiary sector.<br>
* Agriculture is directly affected by the quality of land but other sectors such as industry or services are not affected by the quality of land.<br>
* Besides agricultural production, ownership of land resource also indicates a social status in rural areas.<br>

<p>
Question 11.<br>
‘Erratic monsoon’ and ‘Indebtedness’ are the major problems of Indian agriculture. Suggest and explain the measures to’overcome these problems. (HOTS; Delhi 2016)<br>
Answer:<br>
* Suggestions for Erratic Monsoon<br>
Nature of monsoon is very erratic in India. It is true that the means of irrigations were developed after independence, but the cultivated area under irrigation is only 33%. So, there should be more stress on developing various means of irrigation especially in unirrigated areas of India.<br>
Water disputes between states should be ended in order to provide equitable water resources to each cultivable land in India. There should be stress on rainwater harvesting technique to improve and recharge the groundwater table. So that farmers can easily harvest their land with the use of these sources. Drought resistant crops should be used more in areas where a shortage of water occurs<br>
* Suggestions for Indebtedness<br>
Encourage co-operative credits in rural areas and private lending should be eliminated. Agriculture should be conducted on a scientific basis so that the income of the farmers would increase and they could meet the unproductive expenses and would not be forced to take any loan. Encourage minimum support price policy for all farmers. Rural banks and cooperative banks should provide storage facilities at cheap interest rates.<br>
Question 12.<br>
“Low productivity and fragmentation of land holding are the major problems of Indian agriculture”. Suggest and explain measures to overcome these problems. (HOTS; Delhi 2016)<br>
Answer:<br>
* Measures to overcome the problems of low productivity and are as follows:<br>
1 To aware all the farmers about new technologies like the use of improved implements, seeds, chemicals, manures, etc.<br>
2 Double cropping, better rotation of crops, fighting plant, diseases and pests, etc should be given due emphasis. Different sources of irrigation should be provided to all farmers.<br>
3 Timely soil testing should be done in rural areas by establishing soil testing labs.<br>
4 Institutional credit or loan facilities should be provided to all farmers at low-interest rates, for e.g. Kisan credit card scheme.<br>
* Measures to overcome the problems of fragmentation of land holdings are as follows:<br>
1 Big areas of land which are laying waste can be reclaimed and made fit for cultivation.<br>
2 Co-operative farming can be helpful to check the sub-division and fragmentation of holding. This farming would result in the adoption of modern technology on so-called big farms. In this way, agriculture will become a profitable occupation through economies of large-scale farming.<br>
3 There should be framed a new agricultural policy to improve this situation.<br>
4 The stress of population on land should be reduced.<br>
Question 13.<br>
‘Fragmentation of land holdings’ and ‘degradation of cultivable land’ are the serious problems of Indian agriculture. Suggest and explain measures to overcome these problems. (HOTS; All Indio 2016)<br>
Answer:<br>
For measures to overcome the problems of fragmentation of land holdings,<br>
* Measures to overcome the problems of low productivity and are as follows:<br>
1 To aware all the farmers about new technologies like the use of improved implements, seeds, chemicals, manures, etc.<br>
2 Double cropping, better rotation of crops, fighting plant, diseases and pests, etc should be given due emphasis. Different sources of irrigation should be provided to all farmers.<br>
3 Timely soil testing should be done in rural areas by establishing soil testing labs.<br>
4 Institutional credit or loan facilities should be provided to all farmers at low-interest rates, for e.g. Kisan credit card scheme.<br>
* Measures to overcome the problems of fragmentation of land holdings are as follows:<br>
1 Big areas of land which are laying waste can be reclaimed and made fit for cultivation.<br>
2 Co-operative farming can be helpful to check the sub-division and fragmentation of holding. This farming would result in the adoption of modern technology on so-called big farms. In this way, agriculture will become a profitable occupation through economies of large-scale farming.<br>
3 There should be framed a new agricultural policy to improve this situation.<br>
4 The stress of population on land should be reduced.<br>
* Following are some measures for controlling land degradation:<br>
1 Strip farming should be encouraged in which cultivated crops are sown in alternative strips to prevent water movement.<br>
2 Crop rotation should be in practice.<br>
3 In the hilly regions, contour farming should be done. As it is useful in collecting and diverting the runoff to avoid erosion.<br>
4 To minimise waterlogging and salinisation, modem techniques of irrigation in the fields should be adopted.<br>
Question 14.<br>
Explain the importance of foodgrains in the Indian agricultural economy. Describe any three characteristics of rice cultivation. (All India 2015)<br>
Answer:<br>
Foodgrains acquired a special position in the agriculture economy of India. Within agriculture foodgrains production is by far the major activity, covering about two-thirds of the total cropped area in the country.<br>
It dominates both subsistence and commercial farming all over India. Foodgrains provide almost all the calories and proteins consumed by the poor and provide the rural poor with the bulk of their employment and income. Rice, wheat, bajra, maize, pulses (Gram, tur), etc are examples of foodgrains.<br>
* Characteristics of rice cultivation are as follows:<br>
1 For most of the Indians, rice is a staple food.<br>
2 About 3000 varieties of rice are grown in various agro-climatic regions of India. India ranked 2nd with the production of 22% of rice in the world.<br>
Question 15.<br>
Analyse any five major problems of Indian agriculture. (All India 2014)<br>
OR<br>
Describe any five major problems of Indian agriculture. (Delhi 2008)<br>
OR<br>
Describe any five major problems related to Indian agriculture. (Delhi 2011)<br>
Answer:<br>
Major problems related to Indian agriculture are:<br>
# Dependence of Erratic Monsoon<br>
Dependence on monsoon for water availability is a major problem of Indian agriculture. Means of irrigation were developed after independence, but the cultivated area under irrigation is only 33%. Rest of the cultivated land is dependent on monsoon for soil moisture.<br>
# Low Productivity<br>
India also lags behind in terms of per hectare production and per person production. India is much behind the international level. In India, a large area under cultivation is rainfed. It has a very low yield as compared to the irrigated areas. However, the yield of irrigated areas is low as compared to the international level.<br>
# Constraints of Financial Resources and Indebtedness<br>
Majority of farmers are small, marginal and poor. They have no other source of money to improve their condition. They cannot afford highly expensive inputs like the tractor, thresher, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, tools, etc and new technologies. Most of the farmers are indebted by various institutions and moneylenders.<br></p>
